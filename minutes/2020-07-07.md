## Minutes

- The [installation
   guide](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_service/install_parsec_linux.html) of
   Parsec as a systemd service has been updating with the recent changes on our [Threat
   Model](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_security/parsec_threat_model/threat_model.html)
   and [recommendations for secure
   deployment](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_security/secure_deployment.html).
- The Unix Domain Socket Listener has been updated with a new socket location at
   `/tmp/parsec/parsec.sock`. That allows clients to check for specific permissions on the
   `/tmp/parsec` folder. Those checks are now implemented in the Rust Client.
- Enhanced TCTI configuration for TPM provider to follow the original string format
- Began changes to ListProviders to allow admins to impose a default order in the providers list
