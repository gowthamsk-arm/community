## Minutes

1. Fairly quiet week development-wise
   - PR with new Yocto recipes has been opened
   - [A bug](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/599) has been identified by Paul while
      doing integration testing on an NXP Layerscape platform. The root cause is a lack of
      conformance with the PKCS11 spec in the NXP PKCS11 implementation, and this is a fairly common
      problem. [PR](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/pull/600) is up to fix it. There was an
      option to have this fix dependent on a (runtime) configuration flag, however given that the
      fix does not have any adverse effects for working implementations, we can have it always
      available.
2. Other relevant issues:
   - Regarding the new PKCS11 non-conformance issue, Xueliang suggested assembling documentation for
      all such edge cases that we cover in Parsec, both for usability purposes and to make the case
      for Parsec clearer.
   - Question: "Have we considered creating Parsec clients by writing a base client in a given
      language, for example in Rust, and then creating FFI bindings to it from other languages?"
      Yes, this was considered when the project was first seeded, and having the clients written
      from IPC up natively seems better than using FFI, given that FFI grievances around integrating
      with other libraries are a reason for using Parsec in the first place.
