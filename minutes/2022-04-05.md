## Agenda

1. Updates on the Parsec 1.0.0 release
2. Update on GreenGrass integration and future speaking engagements

## Minutes

1. Parsec 1.0.0 has been released
   - Tag has been applied in the service repo, Github Release has been created, and the crate has
      been upstreamed to crates.io
   - Yocto update is upcoming (as well as for the Parsec tool)
   - Packaged versions of the tool and service are now available on in Fedora and openSUSE
2. Darragh and Marc shared some updates on the GreenGrass integration front, as well as the upcoming
   demos meant to showcase it
   - It seems more likely now that all the components and patches will be upstreamed to the
      appropriate AWS-owned repos at some point soon.
   - A workshop is being created to showcase AWS GreenGrass deployments on Arm boards (on
      RaspberryPis or NXP iMX platforms), with Parsec taking a role in supporting the deployment
   - An issue raised by Darragh was that documentation on where Parsec (and the Parsec tool) are
      available in packaged form is not clear, and that in Fedora the most recent (packaged) Parsec
      tool does not have support for CSR generation - only an old version is available that does not
      support that (v0.3.0)
