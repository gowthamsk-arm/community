## Agenda

- Potential integration between Parsec and Frsca

## Minutes

- Mike Lieberman gave a presentation of [Frsca](https://github.com/buildsec/frsca) and where he
   thinks a collaboration with/integration of Parsec might be relevant
   - Frsca is a fairly new project in the software supply-chain space, aimed at helping companies
      spin up secure build pipelines.
   - It builds upon knowledge summarized in the [Secure Software
      Factory](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/supply-chain-security/secure-software-factory/Secure_Software_Factory_Whitepaper.pdf)
      and [Software Supply Chain Best
      Practices](https://github.com/cncf/tag-security/blob/main/supply-chain-security/supply-chain-security-paper/CNCF_SSCP_v1.pdf)
      whitepapers.
   - The goal is to make builds as auditable and transparent (to the owner) as possible, allowing
      the parties involved to verify the outputs - not just to confirm that the correct steps were
      taken, but perhaps that they were performed on an acceptable set of machines.
   - A few important avenues through which cryptography is leveraged are `cosign`, `spiffe`/`spire`,
      and `Vault`. Parsec integrations would most likely have to go through these projects to make
      their way ultimately into Frsca.
   - An initial goal for the integration could be a joint demo + presentation at a conference.
   - For some more information and demos of Frsca and supply chain security in general, see
