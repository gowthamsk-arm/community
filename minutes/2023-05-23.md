## Agenda

- RSA key generation issue with trusted services backend

## Minutes

- When running parsec tool cli test script against the parsec service configured with trusted
   services backend on N1SDP platform, the script terminates with a "Resource temporarily
   unavailable, WouldBlock". Gowtham investigated this and found out that the parsec tool was timing
   out as the default timeout was set to 60 seconds. The RSA 2048 key generation takes up about 20
   minutes on N1SDP platform which is too long. The delay might be due to trusted services. There
   are new trusted services patches on meta-arm fixing some known issues. Vikas and Gowtham will
   investigate this further.
