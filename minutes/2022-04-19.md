## Minutes

1. Yet another slow week.
   - Yocto recipes for the new versions of the Parsec service and tool have been merged upstream
   - The PR for the PKCS11 export format bug has been merged.
   - A few other questions have cropped up in the TSS and PSA repos.
2. Other topics:
   - It would be good to document somewhere our Yocto assets and/or release process, and perhaps
      also as another Getting Started guide.
