## Agenda

1. Updates on the Parsec 1.0.0 release
2. How do we manage a "default provider list"?

## Minutes

1. Release candidate 3 is out!
   - A new version of `tss-esapi` has been released (7.0.1) which is now included in Parsec.
   - The new RC also contains updates to other dependencies to address a few issues raised by
      package maintainers - see a more details
      [here](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/discussions/538#discussioncomment-2406120)
   - This RC has already been verified on real hardware with a TPM and NitroKey HSM; fuzz tests are
      currently running
2. The new RC brought up an issue, flagged by Peter Robinson:
   - The TS provider cannot be packaged for Fedora since distro packages do not exist for `libts`
      for now, however the TS provider is in our "default" `all-providers` list
   - In the future it seems likely that our all backends will have proper support everywhere, but
      for now the notion of a default list of providers for building is not entirely feasible, since
      some rely on dependencies that aren't generally available
   - At the same time, if people building have to put thought into what they do build, it might be
      too much of a burden to review documentation for them; but this also happens if using
      `all-providers` leads to failures
   - Short-term it might be better to give up the notion of `all-providers` and make everyone select
      what providers to include.
