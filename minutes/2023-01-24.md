## Agenda

- Parsec in Debian

## Minutes

- Gowtham presented the debian packaging process for Parsec and couple of queries were raised by
   Paul with regards to the binary packages for Parsec and avoiding crate version conflicts between
   different distributions. Gowtham will revert back on the channel with clarification on them.
- The ci.sh script of the Parsec repository lists RHEL 8 as a supported distro. This needs to be
   changed as parsec is not yet packaged for RHEL, but is one of the distro that we would want to
   support in the future.
