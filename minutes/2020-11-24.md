## Agenda

1. Fresh news on Parsec work

## Minutes

- The PKCS 11 new abstraction layer is making good progress. Work remaining to check for
   thread-safety and add documentation/tests. Check the `new-abstraction` branch
   [here](https://github.com/hug-dev/rust-pkcs11/tree/new-abstraction) if you are interested.
- The PRs adding a SPIFFE-based authentication are currently being updated for the CI to be able to
   test the functionality.
- Question about a Long Term Support version of Mbed TLS which contains Mbed Crypto as well. The
   `psa-crypto` crate should use that instead of the bespoke current one.
- Trusted Service Provider work is under way, though without the needed dependency upstream.
   Currently the provider supports creating, importing, exporting and destroying keys, as well as
   asymmetric signatures and verification.
