## Minutes

1. Security vulnerability found in `tss-esapi`, but otherwise quiet week.
   - [The issue](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-tss-esapi/pull/344) relates to a dangling
      pointer being passed to the ESYS implementation. The pointer was left dangling by a structure
      being dropped after being created in smaller scope than required for use with the underlying
      API.
   - PR submitted with fixes for the Yocto recipes; the meta-security maintainers have also been
      looking to add runtime tests for the various layers, including now Parsec; Anton has created a
      battery of E2E tests that are run inside QEMU to check the service build and the configuration
      file produced
2. Other updates:
   - Still no luck in setting up a Docker hub organisation for Parsec, but hopefully we'll get there
      with some help from Justin :)
