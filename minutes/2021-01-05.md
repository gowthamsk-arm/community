## Agenda

1. Fresh news on Parsec work
2. Should we try to persuade the [OSS Fuzz](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/) maintainers to add
   Parsec to the projects they test? They state that they require projects "to have a significant
   user base and/or be critical to the global IT infrastructure"
   [(link)](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/getting-started/accepting-new-projects/) - would we
   qualify?
3. How should we plan for the PKCS11 library dependency?
4. CryptoAuthentication library provider [PR](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/pull/303) and
   our versioning process

## Minutes

- Work on the Trusted Service provider is still ongoing. Next two big items are the new
   [operations](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/293) ListClients and DeleteClient
   and the [PKCS11 front-end](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/291).
- The [PKCS11 abstraction PR](https://github.com/mheese/rust-pkcs11/pull/43) has not yet been
   reviewed. The risk is that, if used as a git dependency, it will prevent upstreaming the `parsec`
   crate on crates.io. The ideal solution is to merge it in the `rust-pkcs11` crate and a worse
   solution would be to create our own, new, PKCS11 abstraction crate.
- The PR adding the CryptoAuthentication library provider exposed a lack of documentation of our
   release process. This is going to be documentated in the book. Parsec is heavily relying on the
   Rust interface but it might be a bit too over-the-top to release a new version everytime
   something is needed in Parsec. A solution might be to use git dependencies wherever needed and
   produce releases whenever a new version is required. Discussion to continue on the Slack channel
   and/or the book PR.
- The current Go client is not in a usable state but [jn9e9](https://github.com/jn9e9) has been
   working on it. Status is to be checked.

Item 2 will be postponed to next meeting.
