   hopeful that he has arrived at a encapsulation format that is generally useful. Suggested that
   "activate credentials" be discarded due to their peculiarities and lack of universality.
   Believing that this approach will increase the probability of the work being adaptable to a
   variety of different providers that have incorporated attestation into their designs.
