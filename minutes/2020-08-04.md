## Agenda

1. A quick update on development work
2. @puiterwijk talking about [DBus PARSEC interface](https://github.com/puiterwijk/dbus-parsec)

## Minutes

- A new repo has been created with an initial PR:
   [parsec-tool](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-tool/pull/1), a CLI tool to execute some
   Parsec operations from the terminal
- Work on [`bindgen`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen/pull/1846) to support dynamic
   loading of C APIs.
- Work on a Unix Domain Socket peer credentials authenticator has been started
   ([#199](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/199) and
   [#200](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/200)). A
   [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/75148) has been created on Rust standard library to
   support it.
- New operations have been added in
   [`psa-crypto`](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/pull/50) and are being added to
   Parsec. These are all the PSA Crypto single-part operations. They will be implemented in the Mbed
   Crypto provider first.
- The DBus Parsec Interface project is a daemon exposing a DBus interface and communication to
   Parsec. The daemon contains two interfaces:
   - a Control interface to store secrets
   - a NetworkManager SecretAgent interface used by NetworkManager to retrieve credentials for
      connections
- The project uses RSA encryption and decryption and that was implemented in the [tss-esys
   crate](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-tss-esapi/pull/103) and
   [Parsec](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/pull/213/files).
