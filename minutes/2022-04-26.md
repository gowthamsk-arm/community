## Agenda

1. Paul can report on some current demo activity
2. New version of Spiffe available which solves the issues in [our security
   advisory](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/security/advisories/GHSA-45w3-v3g4-54pm)

## Minutes

1. Paul is working on a demo piece that could stand as a Hello World for Parsec users.
   - The demo will most likely consist of a Docker image containing some minimal functionality to
      verify that the Parsec service is available and functioning correctly on the current system.
   - It would rely on the Parsec tool, and on bespoke, lightweight apps written in a variety of
      languages, all interacting with the Parsec service from within the container.
   - The (runtime) goal of the container will be to provider immediate confirmation to the user
      about the service status. For an illustration of the UX, see
      [this](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01EARH2ZB3/p1651053856955239) Slack message.
   - This demo is *not* related to the work meant to get the service itself running in a container.
2. A new version of `rust-spiffe` has been released which solves the issues we encountered related
   to a segfault in `chrono`/`time`.
   - The service can thus be updated, along with the advisory
   - However, the update will also require changes deeper in the dependency tree, see
