## Agenda

1. Fresh news on Parsec work

## Minutes

- Trusted Service provider work continuing, parallaxsecond/parsec#296 to make it work on CI for
   testing
- Rust PKCS11 new wrapper also almost done, being tested by being integrated in Parsec
- How to deal with the minimum version of Rust supported? [Related
   PR](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-tss-esapi/pull/154). We should maybe remove
   requirement to support old versions of Rust and just follow the current `stable`. It should not
   be a big deal for people to do a `rustup update` when the compilation is failing. It will also
   bring all the advantages of newer features of Rust inside the codebase.
- We should warn users in our changelogs the version of Rust the specific version released was
   tested with.
- Where to put the roadmap? See [this issue](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/294).
   It was discussed that at first we would write the roadmap as a markdown file in the community
   repository. Good way for everyone to see what is the project going to deliver.
