## Agenda

1. Update on the key attestation proposal
2. Review of the 0.8.0 milestone
3. Move some issues to "Discussions"

## Minutes

- Update about Certifyx509: require a key that allows signing and the default TPM endorsement key
   does not. ActivateCredential could work. Sign but not decrypt permissions required for
   Certifyx509.
- The Object Attributes for endorsement keys tend to come from a
   [standard](https://trustedcomputinggroup.org/wp-content/uploads/TCG_IWG_EKCredentialProfile_v2p3_r2_pub.pdf),
   regardless of manufacturer.
- For ActivateCredential we also need another, TPM-specific operation that would allow the verifier
   to perform MakeCredential on their side. This is needed because MakeCredential involves more data
   than just the public part of the endorsement key.
- New flags needed on the request to specify the kind of attestation requested + blob of data.
- Update on the proposal to come. It might be the only deliverable for 0.8.0: a design we are
   confident could be implemented, even only on the TPM.
- Milestone 0.8.0 looks on track!
- Let's move some of the GitHub issues to the "Discussion" tab.
