## Agenda

1. Fresh news on Parsec work
2. How do we handle testing for Arm platforms?

## Minutes

- Two big current items are still the PKCS11 Rust abstraction layer and the Trusted Service
   provider.
- Travis CI now has limited minutes available for OSS projects. It was used throughout our projects
   to do native testing on an Arm platform. The allocated minutes only allow us to do three builds
   per month.
- The GitHub Actions self-hosted runners are not secure as of yet: they directly execute on the
   remote machine without spawning a virtual instance. Can not be used directly.
- We need to look to an alternative of Travis or pay for the time that we need.
- We are at such an high level of abstraction that testing on Arm is not critical, the chances that
   something works on x86 but not Aarch64 are pretty slim.
- For now it was decided that we would disable PR builds for Travis but only keep one per month.
- We might need to look into cross-compilation to Linux on Aarch64. Created [an
   issue](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/300).
