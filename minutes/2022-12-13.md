## Minutes

1. Paul raised a concern about the potential for canceling meetings becoming a habit and suggested
   having status update meetings even if the agenda is empty occasionally.
2. The status of the Attestation POC being worked on by Ionut was discussed, and Ionut mentioned
   that it is still in progress and may give a presentation on the status of the POC soon.
3. Mohamed proposed discussing the use of OpenSSL with parsec as a back-end as a potential topic for
   the next period to work on.
4. The current road map structure was discussed and it was noted that work on the propagation and
   enablement of parsec is not reflected in the Parsec Service or tool and cannot be linked to
   releases. As a result, it was concluded that the document should be decoupled from the releases,
   service, and tool in order to have a wider scope for the project.
5. The meeting ended with a mention of the upcoming holidays.
