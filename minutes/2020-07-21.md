## Agenda

2. A Parsec CLI demo.

## Minutes

1. The
   [ListProviders](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/operations/list_providers.html)
   operation was modified to be prioritised. The priority of each provider is set on the order they
   are declared in the config file.
2. The [Parsec SE driver](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-se-driver/pull/9) was modified to
   be provider agnostic. It uses by default the most priority provider.
3. The [`psa-crypto-sys`](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/rust-psa-crypto/pull/39) crate was
   modified to only require the PSA Crypto header files when generating the interface only.
4. The ExportKey and
   [AsymmetricEncrypt](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/operations/psa_asymmetric_encrypt.html)/Decrypt
   operations were added in the stack and implemented in the Mbed Crypto Provider!
5. Work in ongoing to create a Parsec CLI, named
   [`parsec-tool`](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/issues/202), a demo was made by
   @joechrisellis
