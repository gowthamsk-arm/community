## Agenda

1. Agree the contents of the Parsec v0.9.0 release
2. For the CanDoCrypto implementation for the TPM provider: should we check with the hardware TPM,
   during CanDoCryptoCalls, what it supports?

## Minutes

1. The current contents of the [Parsec Release
   v0.9.0](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/milestone/3) milestone have been agreed upon to
   form the next release of the Parsec service
   - The new release will thus focus mainly on: adding the SQLite KIM; implementing the CanDoCrypto
      operation for most providers; implementing the preparation step and the key attestation using
      ActivateCredential in the TPM provider
   - As this release - through its focus on stability via the SQLite KIM, and on functionality
      discovery via CanDoCrypto - comes as an enhancement to the robustness of the service and to
      user/admin friendliness, we can consider it another step towards an eventual 1.0.0 release,
      following all the stability work done in 0.8.0
2. Since our support in the TPM provider is fairly limited (compare to, for example, the Mbed Crypto
   provider), we might be able to skip asking the TPM for what it supports when a CanDoCrypto
   operation is performed. The TPM specs should specify some minimum set of features that must be
   supported by any implementation adhering to the spec. If that covers everything we permit through
   Parsec, there will be no need to verify with the hardware module!
