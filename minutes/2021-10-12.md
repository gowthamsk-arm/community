- Hugues de Valon

## Agenda

- Go through open issues in the Parsec project board
- Discuss UX of mock service
- KDF implementation missing (needed for creating credentials for ActivateCredential without using a
   TPM).

## Minutes

- No need to go through the issues in the meeting (as there are too many of them), agreed to
   postpone the review of issues for next week's meeting
   - We will carry on with the plan that the 0.9.0 release will be feature-centric, not time-centric
   - A new milestone will be created, and issues assigned to it, along with a Github discussion
      around them
   - Everyone can then review the contents of the release, and we can approve at the next meeting
- The issue we've encountered (and for which a fix PR exists
   [here](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec-mock/pull/7)) is that the mock service doesn't
   know exactly how much data to expect when reading from the socket
   - At the moment the mock reads a bit then goes and checks the list of tests immediately, without
      verifying if more data exists
   - The question is: how to solve this? Three options stand out:
      - make the mock service understand the header and know exactly how much to expect
      - make the mock always check after reading some data if it matches a test case, and if not, it
         keeps on reading
      - make the mock keep reading, with a timeout that makes it stop
   - Given that the mock service is only intended for testing, there is no need to be very careful
      about its behaviour
   - As long as the problem isn't with the protocol (it's just that we don't want to complicate the
      mock service too much) no "high-level" decision is needed
   - The issue will be resolved within the PR linked above
- When investigating how to test an implementation of the [ActivateCredential key attestation
   mechanism](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_client/operations/attest_key_params.html#activatecredential-tpm-provider)
   it became apparent that an implementation (accessible from Rust) of the KDFa algorithm used by
   the TPM is difficult to find
   - The algorithm is used to generate keys used in the MakeCredential operation - a step necessary
      in order to test a functioning stack on top of ActivateCredential
   - The two options available rest on OpenSSL - either OpenSSL v3, for which Rust wrappers do not
      exist, or a RedHat-specific backport that covers the same functionality
   - Our alternative, and the most likely path forward, is to simply use the software TPM server,
      which implements MakeCredential
      - The issue with this approach is that it can't be easily generalized and tends to be a pain;
         it also won't allow us to (fully) implement key attestation based on the ActivateCredential
         mechanism in `parsec-tool`
   - A question has been raised on the TPM.dev forum,
