## Minutes

- OpenSUSE packaging updated to 1.2.0 from 1.2 RC.
- For Fedora packaging, Xueliang will mail Steve Capper and check if its possible to update the
   packages themselves.
- Gowtham is currently working on the parsec failures reported during the RaspberryPi release
   testing. The TPM failures are related to key attestation and they seem to be due to preset
   passwords in the TPM. Gowtham will continue investigating this.
- Parsec maintainers have received an invitation to join the CNCF enterprise GitHub. Paul will check
   with Chris Aniszczyk about the implications of this accepting this.
