## Agenda

- Update on the 0.8.0 release
- Discuss approach to storing public/private parts of TPM keys

## Minutes

- We've decided to pause the 0.8.0 release due to the major bug discovered last week, as described
   [on the Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C01EARH2ZB3/p1629971876014400)
- Initial work on fixing the TPM key persistence issue has begun
   - the new solution will rely on storing two byte buffers for the public and private parts of the
      keys, with the rest of the input to the TSS stack being regenerated for each operation
   - before a proper solution is implemented and upstreamed, an experimental build will be assembled
      for manual testing, just to confirm that the new approach fixes this issue
   - if the fix proves to mitigate the error we were seeing, the fix will be polished and upstreamed
