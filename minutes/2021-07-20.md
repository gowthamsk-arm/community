## Minutes

- Parsec Annual Report accepted during the community meeting. PR to be added in the CNCF repo.
- Where to store the design document for attestation? New page to be added in the book noting the
   new experimental contracts. Seems OK to keep the design document in its Google page.
- Say that this API is experimental and might not be stable. Exclude the new unstable operations in
   the buf YAML file.
- Design of Key Attestation goal of the item for the 0.8.0 release.
- Check with the TS project if the bug with asymmetric encryption is fixed or not. Might impact the
   0.8.0 release if not fixed in time.
- Announce the code freeze date on the public channel for people to prepare. Suggestion of 1st
   August as Code Freeze Date.
- Designs for new capability profiling operations and new SQLite key info manager to be discussed in
   those meetings when finished.
