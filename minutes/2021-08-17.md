## Minutes

- Still waiting on two maintainers for feedback. Testing with Yocto builds of Parsec + TS ongoig.
- Code freeze period as a courtesy window, we'll wrap up the release at the end of it.
- Code freeze remain in effect until beginning of September when the release will happen.
- Wiktor presented his interests in Parsec, mostly around interfacing in Rust with HSMs, TPMs, etc.,
   for a number of projects for Sequoia PGP.
- Discussed the feature gap between what Wiktor would need for his work and what the Parsec service
   can offer:
   - ability to attach more metadata to keys (from a client perspective), and to have more complex
      queries among your keys; use case: being able to assign various labels and offload any
      querying based on them to the service; discussion outcome: the service should stay as simple
      as possible, with this sort of key management pushed up the chain to, e.g., Parsec client
      libraries
   - key discovery and/or import via metadata provided by clients (i.e. for keys that were/are
      provisioned through other means); use case: keys that are created by other processes on the
      system, or provisioned on an air-gapped system; discussion outcome: such a feature hasn't been
      discussed or considered yet as there hasn't been a use case for us to rally around, and our
      backend model was to ignore the presence of other entities on the platform; "ownership" of the
      keys in Parsec world could also prove to be contentious if clients can get access to each
      other's keys
   - provision keys making use of backend-specific features, e.g. keys that are bound to specific
      TPM PCR values; use case: having keys that are only usable when the platform is in a certain
      state; discussion outcome: this hasn't been something we implemented simply due to the
      lowest-denominator problem of our current interfaces - you can't access PCRs for both TPMs and
      PKCS11, so we default to not providing that functionality; a better approach would be to
      define a more abstract interface, in the vein of key attestation, and which would use whatever
      mechanism is available on the platform
- Some of these ideas will be brought-up in the public discussion forums and debated, possibly
   discussed further in other meetings in the future.
