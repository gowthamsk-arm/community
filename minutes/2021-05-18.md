1. Creometry project introduction
2. New version of PKCS#11, should we use it?

## Minutes

- Mounir to present Creometry, slides are here. (NOTE: Presentation has been deleted, so the link
   has been removed)
- Parsec interest around device attestation: prove that a node is not malicious (edge node could be
   provided by anyone). Current investigation in Parsec is around key attestation: proving that keys
   are RoT-backed.
- Parsec to give portable solution around asymmetric crypto, where the private key is in hardware.
   Combined with key attestation to prove it, might give elements of solution.
- Current version of PKCS11 we use is 2.4, new version is 3. Investigation needed to check what are
   the differences.
