## Minutes

   [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GsWbNwuU4k34ZYcE7K9EmUEX1QkYdhqyuW0pIN08gA8/edit?usp=sharing).
- Parsec interest around device attestation: prove that a node is not malicious (edge node could be
   provided by anyone). Current investigation in Parsec is around key attestation: proving that keys
   are RoT-backed.
- Parsec to give portable solution around asymmetric crypto, where the private key is in hardware.
   Combined with key attestation to prove it, might give elements of solution.
- Current version of PKCS11 we use is 2.4, new version is 3. Investigation needed to check what are
   the differences.
