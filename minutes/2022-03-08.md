## Agenda

1. Updates on the Parsec 1.0.0 release
2. Discussion on adding support for MAC operations

## Minutes

1. Release Candidate 2 is expected to become the final release:
   - Tests have been run on the RaspberryPi 3 + TPM, and using the Nitrokey HSM as backends
   - Fuzz testing is currently running
   - No other feedback available
2. It seems possible that generating MACs would be needed in the long run, so issues will be opened
   to cover this piece of work
   - At the moment we only have the protobuf operations implemented for MACs, but nothing above that
      (interface, service, client)
   - Even if we have the MAC operations implemented we'll need to expand support in the other
      providers for creating symmetric keys.
