## Agenda

1. Fresh news on Parsec work
2. Should we add features in the Rust client? Example with SPIFFE-based authentication.
3. How and where should we maintain the project roadmap?

## Minutes

- The `rust-spiffe` dependency also depends on `grpcio` with either finds of compile natively the
   gRPC Core library. As a result the compile time is increased and the binary is bigger for the
   client.
- Main concern is the complaints from people who are building Parsec based applications with the
   knowledge that they will not need the SPIFFE-based authentication method.
- For most other cases: you do not have enough knowledge of where you Cloud Native application is
   going to be deployed to know that you will never need this authenticator.
- The gRPC Core build is self-contained and should not cause many compilation issues.
- The binary should get lighter for a release build.
- **Decision:** a config flag will be set, but will be on by default. People with enough knowledge
   of their system will be able to remove it.
- The Project Roadmap agenda item was not discussed and is rolled to the next community meeting.
