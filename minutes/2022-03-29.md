2. Update on GreenGrass integration work
3. Discussion on docs for client libraries

## Minutes

1. RC3 will be tagged as the 1.0.0 version of Parsec:
   - All the testing is complete and no other issues have been found, no feedback reported for RC3.
   - We could wait more for feedback, but it seems fair to go through with the release and make
      patch releases later on if needed.
   - We just need to update the changelog and then upstream and tag the code.
2. Ongoing work to polish the GG stack and prepare for demos and presentations.
   - Darragh & crew are working on upstreaming the required changes to get the integration to work
      out-of-the-box (changes to the [AWS IoT Device
      SDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-java-v2))
   - Bugs are being fixed, new features added in our side of things - a new (recorder) demo might be
      in order to showcase the progress.
   - Anton currently has [a PR](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/pull/595) open to add RNG
      support in the TPM provider in order to demo GG with a hardware TPM; he has verified that it
      works on the board.
3. We need to improve documentation for client libraries.
   - The Parsec book contains some [documentation and
      links](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/parsec_users.html), but not for all, and
      some things are still
      ["TODO"](https://parallaxsecond.github.io/parsec-book/getting_started/linux_x86.html#rust-example)
   - The only place where we have proper documentation in line with expectations for that language
      is Rust; ideally, we'd have that available for all languages
   - the Parsec website has no such links or guidance for where to look further for information
