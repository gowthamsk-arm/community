## Minutes

- Waiting on two maintainers for feedback.
- Fine to not include Trusted Service provider now if the issues are only on the distributions side.
- TS code not included in the source bundle generated by GH because it is a git submodule.
- Possibility to create a branch of the `0.8.0` tag for future bugs.
- Code freeze period as a courtesy window, we could release anyway at the end of it.
- Code freeze remain in effect until beginning of September when the release will happen.
- Other testers:
   - Hugues: Raspberry PI with hardware TPM
   - Pete: software TPM and HSM
   - Wiktor: AET and Yubikeys (but failed, see
      [here](https://github.com/parallaxsecond/parsec/discussions/478#discussioncomment-1153744))
   - Paul: NitroKey (not worse since 0.7.2).
- Instructions would be nice for testers, to make their life easier.
- Possible to create a subset (or grouping) of tests for those that are relevent for testers.
- CryptoCanDo instead of CanDo
- Gilles to be added as a reviewer on the PR of the book.
